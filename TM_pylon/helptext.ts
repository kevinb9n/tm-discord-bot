**2nd arg**: expansion, p for prelude, v for venus, c for colony, t for turmoil, o for promo. You can write in any order. You can also use 'all' or 'any' instead.
**3rd+ args**: 'wgt' for world government terraforming, 'vp' for real-time vp, 'draft' for round draft, 'full draft' for both round and initial drafts, 'random' for randomized milestones and awards, 'fast' for fast mode (no end turn option). You can write these terms in any order. Default is 'any/i don't care' for all of these options. To turn anything off put '-' (minus sign) in front of the term like '-vp -wgt'. Use 'off' if you want turn everything off.
